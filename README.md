# Uncommon Python Exception Handling

This repository showcases a Python code example demonstrating an uncommon scenario in exception handling.  The code specifically addresses situations where both `ZeroDivisionError` and `TypeError` can potentially occur within a single function. The example includes a nested try-except block that handles TypeErrors more granularly, differentiating between cases where type mismatches are simply invalid numerical operations and cases that might indicate different underlying problems.

The solution shows how to handle such exceptions correctly. This is an uncommon error pattern, and this repository is designed to illustrate a robust approach for handling these issues.
